(a) The positively \ncharged substrate because the emitted electrons are more than the incident electrons. The CNT provides electron supply \nto the surrounding substrate in region C (C for CNT), so region C is charged less positively than region S (S for \nsubstrate). (b) Electron emission trajectories in different regions. Region C, with a width of >30 nm, emits more electrons \nto the detector. (c-d) The schematic drawing of the signal intensity and SEM image contrast of the sample. ",
