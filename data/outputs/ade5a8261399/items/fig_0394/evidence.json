LVSEM images of polymer-sorted CNT array obtained by the (a, c, e) Upper \ndetector and (b, d, f) Top detector with a deceleration voltage of (a, b) 0, (c, d) -100 V, and \n(e, f) -300V. The schematic drawing illustrates the electron trajectories at different \ndeceleration voltages. The red and dashed red arrows represent the trajectories of low-",
