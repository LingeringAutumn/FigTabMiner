The charge contrast is lost in the LVSEM image \nof high-density CNT arrays since the electron supply regions overlap with each other. \nAs illustrated in Figure 3, polymer-sorted CNT arrays loaded on the insulating substrate \nconsist of high-density aligned CNTs and unavoidable residual polymers, thus three kinds of ",
