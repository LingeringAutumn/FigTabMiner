Characteristic spectral peaks\nare extracted from raw IR, Raman, UV, NMR, or MS data and used to construct natural language\nprompts. These are input to a frozen large language model fine-tuned via LoRA. The model is trained\nto autoregressively generate molecular structures in SMILES format, supervised by the ground-truth\nsequence.",
